So we can see we were able to add
1.AccOnCommand
2.AcOffCommand -Not Implemeted
3.LigtOnCommand
4.LigtOffCommand- NOt Implemeted
5.AccTempcommand.

We could have include the tempup,tempdown, volumeup,volumedown functionalites to the the code without
impacting the Command Class.
IF we need any new features we need to contact with our Reciever Class( Light and Ac) and ConcreteCommand class.

MyRemoteController is just a Invoker class whose main objective is to just hold the reference object and can
trigger command execution .It doens't need to know any details how the command are getting executed.


We need to see the Better Code for Undo and Redo in our Next Version(v3)
